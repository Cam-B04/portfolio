## Presentation

Welcome to my portfolio which is a work in progress. I have recently graduated a PhD degree in deep learning applied to physics. I am currently looking for a data scientist job opportunity.

## My work

### PhD

I have published an [article](https://npg.copernicus.org/articles/28/347/2021/npg-28-347-2021.html) during my PhD about the potential of [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) ([Goodfellow, Ian et al. 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)) for numerical weather prediction (NWP). 

The objective of the article is to demonstrate the ability of GANs to produce realistic climate data and their interesting properties regarding its usage in NWP.
