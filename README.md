# Camille Besombes' portfolio

## Presentation

Welcome to my portfolio which is a work in progress. I am currently working as a Research assistant at McGill University in the dentistry department. My team and I, are developing 
a computer vision algorithm to detect oral cancer from photographic images. We are also interested in quantifying uncertainties from deep learning predictions which is an important topic in health data science to be able to put AI solution in productions. I have a PhD degree in deep learning applied to physics. I started to build a portfolio with mainly side projects because of the NDA restriction on my PhD. 

I am currently looking open to job offers to work in deep learning development and closer to operational deep learning. Please see my CV attached:

## My work

### [Producing realistic climate data with GANs](https://github.com/Cam-B04/Producing-realistic-climate-data-with-GANs)

I have published an [article](https://npg.copernicus.org/articles/28/347/2021/npg-28-347-2021.html) during my PhD about the potential of [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) ([Goodfellow, Ian et al. 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)) for numerical weather prediction (NWP). 

The objective of the article is to demonstrate the ability of GANs to produce realistic climate data and their interesting properties regarding its usage in NWP.
