# Camille Besombes' portfolio

## Presentation

Welcome to my portfolio which is a work in progress. I have recently graduated a PhD degree in deep learning applied to physics. I started to build a portfolio with mainly side projects because of the NDA restriction on my PhD. 

I am currently looking for a data scientist job opportunity in Montreal or in remote. Feel free to contact me if you are interested 

## My work

### [Producing realistic climate data with GANs](https://github.com/Cam-B04/Producing-realistic-climate-data-with-GANs)

I have published an [article](https://npg.copernicus.org/articles/28/347/2021/npg-28-347-2021.html) during my PhD about the potential of [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) ([Goodfellow, Ian et al. 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)) for numerical weather prediction (NWP). 

The objective of the article is to demonstrate the ability of GANs to produce realistic climate data and their interesting properties regarding its usage in NWP. 

### [Bixi personnal projects](https://github.com/Cam-B04/bixi_open_data)
